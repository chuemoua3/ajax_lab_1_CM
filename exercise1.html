3. Hide the results from the previous actions
    -Get all posts
    -Get post with id of 10
    -Get the comments from post with id of 12 
    -note: comments are part of a different data model, you'll need to structure your endpoint to ask for all of the comments that belong to post #12

    6. Replace the post with id of 12 and render the responseJSON
